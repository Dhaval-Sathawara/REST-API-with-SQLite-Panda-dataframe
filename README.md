## What is REST

REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. It has become one of the most widely used approaches for building web-based APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

REST is not a protocol or a standard, it is an architectural style. During the development phase, API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

Like the other architectural styles, REST also has its guiding principles and constraints. These principles must be satisfied if a service interface is to be referred to as RESTful.
